# Step 2: Install Docker deployment capability

Now that we have added a device, a deployment capability to deploy services needs to be installed. Click on the green button on the right side of your resource and select `DOCKER`:

The installation of the deployment capability on your device is triggered and will take some time. You can see the coressponding job in the `Jobs` section:

After the installation job was successfull you should see the `Docker` in the Deployment Capabilites coloumn of your device:
